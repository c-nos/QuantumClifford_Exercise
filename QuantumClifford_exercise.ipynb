    "We can see that after trying the `NoisyStabilizerOverlap` function for many different values of the probability for iid depolarization noise, the derivative of the overlap always comes out to 0. I think there is some issue with how the `StochasticAD` handles my implementation of the inner product with random noise which does not implement the propagation of the $ \\epsilon $ parameter. I have tried many different variations without success, including applying simple iid bitflip noise by cycling through a random variable `rand(Bernoulli(p),nqubit(s1))` and flipping the bit when a `1` occurs in the random variable via an `if` statement. But this did not work with the `derivative_estimate()` or `stochastic_triple()` functions and gave error messages. According to the `StochasticAD` documentation, it does not support randomness generated by `if` statements with discrete random input. I tried other variations for bitflips bypassing applying the bitflips via the `if` statement logic, but these got errors as well when interacting with `derivative_estimate()` or `stochastic_triple()`. Below we show another attempt to try to get the `stochastic_triple` to interact with the inner product as we would hope while avoiding the `if` statement logic:"

    "However, we can say in either the case of bitflip noise or depolariation noise, that these types of noise simply change the signs of some of the generators of a stabilizer state, as conjugation of a Pauli operator by other, different Pauli operators simply changes the sign. If two stabilizer states $S(\\ket{\\phi}),S(\\ket{\\psi})$ share a common generator but with opposite signs, their inner product is $0$, and otherwise is $2^{(-s/2)}$, where $s$ is the minimum, over all sets of generators $ { \\{P_1, ..., P_n\\}} $ for $ S(\\ket{\\phi}) $ and $ { \\{Q_1, ..., Q_n\\}} $ for $ S(\\ket{\\psi}) $, of the different $ i $ values where $ Q_i \\neq P_i $. So (roughly), if $p$ varies, we may expect the value of the inner product to change as there are more or less bitflips, thereby in principle allowing for a non-zero value of the derivative `d𝔼[dot(s1,s2)]/dp`. So this would be nice to fix....."
